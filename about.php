                <p class="col lead-zuledu">
                    We create, teach, and learn together across three garden-like campuses with leading-edge facilities that support independent inquiry, critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaborative study.
                    We play sports, put on drama productions, paint, sculpt, engineer, and create. Our students are able to explore and grow in a safe environment and are encouraged to follow their passions to be as successful as they can be.
